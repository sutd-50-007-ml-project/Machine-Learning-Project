## How to Run the Code

### Requirements 
Please make sure you have installed Python 3.4 or above!

### Getting started
1. Clone the repository on your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/sutd-50-007-ml-project/Project.git
```
2. Navigate into the `Project` folder
```
cd path-to-repository
cd Project
```


### Question 1

1. Run the code with your training and test set files, and indicate the path for the output.
```
python3 Part1.py ES/train ES/dev.in ES/dev.p1.out
python3 Part1.py RU/train RU/dev.in RU/dev.p1.out
```
2. Generate scores for the prediction
```
python3 EvalScript/evalResult.py ES/dev.out ES/dev.p1.out
python3 EvalScript/evalResult.py RU/dev.out RU/dev.p1.out
```


### Question 2

### Question 3
To run the code for Q3 and produce a dev.p3.out for both ES and RU, replace the paths to the appropriate ES/RU files with your own.
Since the code for Q3 includes some of the functions written for Q2, it is necessary to replace the paths in the codes for both Q2 and Q3.
Specifically, the lines that need to be replaced are:

Lines 79, 80, 179 and 181 in Part2.py, and
Lines 117, 118, 121 and 123 in Part3.py

To run the evaluation script, simply open up the terminal and type the following:
python3 path_to_evalResult.py path_to_dev.out path_to_dev.p3.out

### Question 4
To run the code for Q3, replace the paths to the appropriate ES/RU files with your own in the following lines:
Lines 133-136, 150 and 155 in Part4.py

To run the evaluation script, open up the terminal and type the following:
python3 path_to_evalResult.py path_to_dev.out path_to_dev.p4.out
